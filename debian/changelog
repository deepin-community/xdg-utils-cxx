xdg-utils-cxx (1.0.1-3.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * debian/*.symbols: Dropped, use shlibs file instead to avoid
    C++ symbol mess. Using symbols file is also unnecessary since
    the version string is embedded in SONAME. (Closes: #1004109)
  * debian/*.shlibs: Added, use required version (>= 1.0.1).
  * debian/control: Fix typo.
  * debian/control: Let xdg-utils-cxx depends on xdg-utils-cxx-dev
    for proper package transition.
  * debian/control: Drop ${shlibs:Depends} substvar for dev package.
